# S3 (Object Storage) 

S3 is Amazon's object-storage solution.  Object-storage is ideal for unstructured data (images, videos, logs, backups) that does not require frequent editing.  S3 objects are stored in buckets, and are accessed through APIs or SDKs (programmatic access).  Buckets reside in a chosen region, are scalable (no hard limit), and highly durable (11 nines of durability), making S3 an ideal service for compliance archiving, massive library storage, audit trails, ML training data, etc.  S3 objects are easily accessible but not easily modified, making this service ideal for persistent storage. The S3 service offers a cost effective (pay as you go) solution for various data storage needs.

| Objects | Buckets |
| - | - |
| Key | Object |
| Value | Folder* |
| MetaData |

*S3 does not have Folders in the sense of a traditional filesystem, all S3 objects will still live at the bucket scope (no hierarchy).
